Virtual_Disk_Driver
===================

There are various aspects to this project. Some of the simulation of the project was written by my 
instructor in order to set up the project. The following files were written by me:
    -smsa_driver.c/.h
    -smsa_cache.c/.h
    -smsa_client.c
    -smsa_server.c
    -Makefile

To build this project, simply download all folders; placing the makefile it the top directory. 
After navigating to this directory from the command prompt, just type "make" and enter.
